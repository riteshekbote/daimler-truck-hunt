[HYP] Developer Portal GraphQL Introspection & Mutation Exposure
class: OTHER
asset: developer.as.api.daimlertruck.com
confidence: 75
reasoning: HTTP 200 on root path suggests active developer portal; such portals commonly expose GraphQL playground, introspection, or API docs with mutation access
evidence_needed: GraphQL endpoint responding to introspection query; mutations accepting unauthenticated requests
verify_steps: GET / → check for GraphQL playground/Apollo/GraphiQL UI; POST /graphql with introspection query `{__schema{types{name fields{name}}}}`; POST /graphql with test mutation if schema exposed
impact: Full API schema enumeration → unauthorized mutations (data tampering, BOLA) → Critical/High
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] Capacitor Admin Panel Authentication Bypass / Default Credentials
class: AUTH
asset: capacitor-admin.as.api.daimlertruck.com
confidence: 65
reasoning: Admin subdomain pattern across 6 environments (as/dev/eu/na/tst); unprobed HTTP status; capacitor suggests Ionic/Capacitor admin dashboard — often left with weak defaults
evidence_needed: Login page accessible; default/weak credentials work; auth bypass via SQLi/JWT flaw/IDOR
verify_steps: GET / → identify login form / tech stack; GET /api/health or /actuator/health for debug endpoints; POST /login with common defaults (admin/admin, admin/password); check for JWT in localStorage/sessionStorage via source view
impact: Full admin access → tenant data, config, user mgmt → Critical
testability: PASSIVE
[HYP] AuthZ Service OAuth/OIDC Misconfiguration (redirect_uri, PKCE, state)
class: OATH
asset: authz.as.api.daimlertruck.com
confidence: 55
reasoning: 7 authz.* subdomains (all 404 on /) suggest centralized auth service; OAuth/OIDC endpoints typically live at /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server, /authorize, /token, /introspect, /revoke
evidence_needed: Open redirect on /authorize; PKCE not enforced; state parameter not validated; token endpoint leaks client secrets
verify_steps: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server; GET /.well-known/openid-configuration; GET /authorize?client_id=test&redirect_uri=https://evil.com&response_type=code&scope=openid; POST /token with various grant_types
impact: Account takeover via code theft; token leakage → High/Critical
testability: PASSIVE
[PARKED] Capacitor Admin Panel Authentication Bypass / Default Credentials: confidence 65 but verify_steps require POST /login (mutating) — violates passive-first rule for live assets; needs scoped auth-helped test
[PARKED] AuthZ Service OAuth/OIDC Misconfiguration: confidence 55 < 60 threshold; 404 on root path means endpoints may not exist; speculative without evidence
[FINAL] Developer Portal GraphQL Introspection & Mutation Exposure — **survives**: passive GET/POST to public GraphQL endpoint is read-only introspection; no mutation execution needed for proof; highest priority asset with concrete verify steps
[NEXT] PROBE: GET https://developer.as.api.daimlertruck.com/ → capture response body, headers, tech stack; then POST https://developer.as.api.daimlertruck.com/graphql with `{"query":"{__schema{types{name fields{name}}}}"}` to test introspection
[LEARN] REJECTED network DoS @ all assets: program explicitly excludes DoS/DDoS and account-lockout
[LEARN] REJECTED SSL/TLS best practices @ www.daimlertruck.com: out of scope per policy
[LEARN] REJECTED Clickjacking @ www.daimlertruck.com: requires demonstrated exploit per policy
[LEARN] ACCEPTED GraphQL introspection @ developer.*: high-value, passive, in-scope (API logic flaw)
[LEARN] ACCEPTED Admin panel discovery @ capacitor-admin.*: high-value, requires auth-helped verification
[LEARN] ACCEPTED OAuth misconfig @ authz.*: high-value if endpoints exist, passive discovery first
[RISK] daimler-truck: 78 — 6 live developer portals (HTTP 200) likely expose GraphQL/API docs; 6 unprobed admin panels across environments; authz service surface; CloudFront takeover flag on www; broad scope covering all subsidiaries increases blast radius
